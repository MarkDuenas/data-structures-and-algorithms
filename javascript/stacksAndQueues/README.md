# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement Stacks and Queues Data Structures using javascript ES6 classes.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create Stacks and Queues and their coresponding methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Using ES6 Classes created Stack and Queue and put each method inside that will interact with the storage data inside the classes.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->

    - `push()` - adds an item to the top of the stack.
    - `pop()` - removes an item from the top of the stack.
    - `peek()` - returns the top item from the stack.
    - `isEmpty()` - checks if stack is empty.

  # Queue
